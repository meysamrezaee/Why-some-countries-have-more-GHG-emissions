Project name: why some countries have more GHG emissions

Goal: Collect multiple variables from different dataset, merge them into one dataset, and find out which variables affects green house gas (GHG) emissions and which don't.

Skills required:
  - Data collection
  - Python programming
  - Understanding Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn libraries
  - Understanding statistical concepts such as correlation, scatter plots, and histograms

Challenges:
  - Data needs to be collected from multiple sources and merge together into a single dataset

Results:
  - Variables that have a high correlation with CO2 emission:
    - Population: 0.85
    - Surface area: 0.51
    - GDP: 0.94
    - Fossil fuel production: 0.87
    - Fossil fuel consumption: 0.997
  - Variables that are not correlated with CO2 emissions:
    - Urban population percentage: -0.13
    - GDP per capita: -0.13
    - Exchange rate: -0.03
    - Life expectancy: -0.12
    - Fertility rate: -0.05
    - Infant mortality: 0.09
